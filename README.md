# YelpCamp

This project was built to practice how to build a full-stack web application.
The project uses Node.js, express, ejs templating, and MongoDB. The user can
create, view, update, and delete different campsites and their associated
information. The goal in the future is to add the ability to rate campsites and
store comments on a campsite in the database. Currently, this project is configured
to run on a Cloud9 online development environment which already has node and npm
downloaded. You can run this project by creating a similar environment and importing
all of the files.
